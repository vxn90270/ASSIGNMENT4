QUESTION-1: In the first question we will find out the dataset using the linear regression here at first we have to import the Salary_Data.csv and we have used pandas as pd and numpy as np and also the different preprocessings and imported seaborn as sns and inorder to find out the data set we use the command and after running it we get the headset data values and after that we use the train_test partitions with size1/3 and default as random state is zero and after we train and predict the model and after we find out the mean_squared error with mean_squared_error(Y_Test,Y_Pred) and we have to get training data and testing data we use commands plot/show to get the scatter plot 
this is all about the linear regression to the provided data set 

QUESTION-2: Here we use the k-means clustering first we will find out the head data set and we will remove the null values using the mean and after that we find the silhouette score using the k-means clustering we have to import and find out the score we will get the score of some value i.e.,silhouette score

QUESTION-3: Here we use the scaling clustering which is different from k-means clustering  here we use the preprocessing scaling and fix it in the scaler and inorder to get the array we use transform and next with the sklearn cluster we will fix it in a k-means clusters and also to predict the scaling cluster and to find out the score we will need to print the score after applying scaling we will get the silhouette score after applying scaling 

When compared to scores of  k-means clustering and scaling clustering, scaling clustering score is high compared to k-means clustering
